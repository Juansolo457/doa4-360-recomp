# counterpart of tools/setup.ps1; from graw360-recomp's and doax2-360-recomp's):
#   1. third_party/rexglue-sdk-bd833a2: ReXGlue's source at the nightly 0.10.0.24-dev.gbd833a2's
#      commit with this project's patches (tools/patches), checked against the same patched tree
#      as on Windows (12884d9, GRAW's set plus vexptefp-underflow), then the Linux-only ones on top
#      (fixes in the SDK's runtime that only the Linux build uses);
#   2. that SDK built and installed into its out/install/linux-amd64, RelWithDebInfo and Release:
#      the libraries the game links, the patched Xenos renderer plugin (Vulkan; Linux has no
#      D3D12) and the patched code generator, which the SDK installs from Release only.
# Needs clang (20 or later), CMake 3.25+, Ninja, git, python3 and the SDK's system libraries
# (docs/SETUP.md, "Linux"). The SDK build takes a while the first time (FFmpeg among others).
#   tools/setup-linux.sh             # all of it (skips what is there already)
#   tools/setup-linux.sh --force     # replace an existing SDK source checkout and rebuild
#   tools/setup-linux.sh --jobs 12
# DOA4_SDK_DIR puts the SDK checkout elsewhere (tools/build-deck.sh: the SDK writes its binaries
# into its own tree, so a second build environment needs a second checkout).

# Then, in their own commit. graw360-recomp's four (its Linux tree is f481d5e after them): the
# game's launch path given to the title; a fault no handler claims crashes with a host backtrace
# instead of re-faulting forever, and RenderDoc is used only when it's already in the process
# (SteamOS installs librenderdoc.so, so a plain dlopen loaded it into every run); guest memory's
# shared segment is unlinked once created (named, it outlived every hard exit in /dev/shm and
# filled it); the crash report's backtrace runs under a 5 s alarm.
# doax2-360-recomp's three, for this engine (DOA4 imports the same system-link socket calls and
# uses XAPI fibers): guest ports below 1024 used 10000 higher (Linux refuses low ports to a normal
# user; the system-link VDP socket binds port 1000), for binds and for peers on the local network
# only (here, not yet in DOAX2: a server elsewhere keeps its port); ioctlsocket's Winsock commands
# (FIONBIO, FIONREAD) translated to Linux's, any other passed on as it is (here, not yet in DOAX2),
# and a failed socket call's errno reported to the guest as its Winsock code (WSAEWOULDBLOCK, ...):
# DOAX2 never drew a first frame without both;
# and a thread fiber destroyed from another thread no longer clears that thread's current fiber
# (a guest thread's exit crashed the main thread's next SwitchToFiber).
# This project's two, from the Steam Deck's profile of a fight: a wait on several handles sleeps
# until one may be signaled (it slept 0 ms in its last millisecond, so an alertable one, run in
# 1 ms slices, spun a core: the audio worker's), and the GPU command thread looks up a register's
# info only when the debug message it's for would be written (a tenth of that thread's time).
